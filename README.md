Monkeytype Clone
A web-based typing test application that simulates the functionality of Monkeytype, designed to measure typing speed in Words Per Minute (WPM). The application includes options for tests with 10, 25, and 50 words, dynamic text color feedback, a real-time graph displaying WPM over time, and machine learning analysis to personalize the typing experience.

Features
Typing Test: Choose between 10, 25, and 50-word tests.
Dynamic Feedback: Correct characters turn blue, incorrect ones turn red.
Real-Time WPM Graph: Displays WPM over time with smooth lines.
Machine Learning Analysis: Predicts user performance trends based on typing data and customizes tests.

Machine Learning Customization
Performance Analysis: Uses scikit-learn to analyze which words took the longest to type.
Customized Tests: Generates customized typing tests focusing on words that need improvement, enhancing the learning experience.

Setup
Clone the Repository:


Copy code
git clone https://github.com/randyren278/monkeytype-clone.git
cd monkeytype-clone
Set Up Virtual Environment:
